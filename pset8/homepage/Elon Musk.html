                <p class ="text">African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal
                and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in,
                as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed
                an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a
                Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the
                greater economic opportunities available in the United States.</p>
                <h1 class = "heading2">SpaceX And Paypal</h1>
                <p class ="text">Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania,
                Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in
                physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had
                much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and
                business directories to online newspapers.
