                <p class ="textSteve">Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American
                business magnate, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief
                executive officer (CEO), and co-founder of Apple Inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar
                , a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar, and
                the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal
                computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.</p>
                 <h1 class ="heading2">Apple</h1>
                 <p class ="text">Although the Apple I sold mainly to hobbyists, it generated enough cash to enable Jobs and Wozniak to improve and refine their design. In 1977, they introduced the Apple II -- the first personal computer with color graphics and a keyboard. Designed for beginners the user-friendly Apple II was a tremendous success, ushering in the era of the personal computer. First-year sales topped $3 million. Two years later, sales ballooned to $200 million.

But by 1980, Apple's shine was starting to wear off. Increased competition combined with less than stellar sales of
the Apple III and its follow-up, the LISA, caused the company to lose nearly half its market to IBM. Faced with
declining sales, Jobs introduced the Apple Macintosh in 1984.</p>
